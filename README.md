## Getting and Cleaning data
This project contains R code to clean the UCI dataset
The R script will do the following:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the dataset
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

In order to run the script is to download the script to a directory and then run source("analysis.R") in R and you should be good to go.
